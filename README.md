# FileManagementService
This is a .net core restful API to manage files on Azure Blob Storage

For Azure Blob Storage there are three levels of libraries available in nuget package manager:

WindowsAzure.Storage - up to v9.3.3 - don't use this anymore.
Microsoft.Azure.Storage - v9.4.0 to v11.1.7 - older - Not recommended 
Azure.Storage - v12.x - I have used this library as this is latest of all available.

Also, Please use your own Azure - Account name and key in order to test this API.
Due to time constraint, I couldn't complete ReOrderFiles Method for the API.
